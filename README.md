## Overview

StockSense is an application that allows users to integrate their investment accounts and track their portfolio performance in real-time. Some of the key features include:

- **Plaid Link Integration:** The application uses the Plaid Link API for secure authentication and retrieval of user's financial holdings, including details such as ticker symbols, quantities, and cost basis.

- **Historical and Real-Time Performance Monitoring:** Utilizing Finnhub's REST API and WebSocket services, StockSense provides both historical and real-time price information for tracking portfolio performance.

- **Real-Time Candlestick Visualizations:** Powered by the JP Morgan Perspective Framework, StockSense renders minute-by-minute candlestick charts. These candles are aggregated in real-time during trading hours.

- **Access/Refresh Token Authentication:** The application employs JWTs and a Token Blacklist approach using Redis for robust access and refresh token-based authentication. Learn more about the Authentication Service [here](link_to_authentication_service_documentation).

**Technologies Used:** TypeScript, Node.js, React.js, Socket.IO, WebSockets, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kysely, Jest.

## Usage

**Prerequisites**:
  - Please make sure to have a Plaid API Key ready. You can get your free API Key [here](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup)
  - Please ensure you have Node Version Manager (nvm) and the TypeScript Compiler installed. You can verify both are installed by running these commands:
    ```bash
      nvm -v  # To verify nvm installation
      tsc -v  # To verify tsc installation
    ```
### Running the Node.js Backend

1. First clone this repository and navigate to server/:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shayan10/stock-sense.git
  # Navigate to server/
  cd server
  # Install dependencies
  npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file with the following information. The `DATABASE_URL` variable is required locally for the `node-pg-migrate` module.

Here is an example template of the `.env` file: 

```bash
  POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
  POSTGRES_DB=name
  POSTGRES_USER=johndoe
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=helloWorld
  POSTGRES_PORT=5432
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://POSTGRES_USER:POSTGRES_PASSWORD@localhost/POSTGRES_DB
  JWT_SECRET=example-key
  PORT=3000
  PLAID_CLIENT_ID=example-key
  PLAID_CLIENT_SECRET=example-key
  FINNHUB_API_KEY=example-key
```

If you would like to run this project locally, please make sure you have a running instance of PostgreSQL and Redis on your system.
Otherwise, you can run this project using Docker.

```bash
  # Sets up the PostgreSQL and Redis containers
  docker-compose up -d
```

3. Then, run the following commands:
```bash
  # To run the migrations
  npm run migrate:up
  # Generating the TypeScript definitions from the Database Tables
  npm run generate:types
  # Then, start the server
  npm run dev
```

You should then see this result:
```bash
> stock-sense@1.0.0 dev
> nodemon

[nodemon] 2.0.22
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): src/**/*
[nodemon] watching extensions: ts,json
[nodemon] starting `ts-node ./src/index.ts`
Connected to redis!
Connected to Postgres!
Server started on port 3000
```
### Running the React App
1. Navigate to the `client/` directory in a separate window: `cd client/`

2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

## Optimizations

- Reduced the time complexity of inserting user transactions into the Database from  ***O(n<sup>3</sup>)*** to ***O(n)*** utilizing HashMaps

Each investment a user has belongs to an account, has some quantity and cost basis, and is a type of security. With this information located in three separate arrays, the naive implementation of inserting these into the SQL Database was **O(n<sup>3</sup>)**. However, since each holding also consists of a unique account ID and security ID, this insertion can be simplified to **O(n)** time by utilizing hash maps. 

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "account_id": "5Bvpj4QknlhVWk7GygpwfVKdd133GoCxB814g",
      "balances": {
        ...
      },
      "name": "Plaid Brokerage",
      "official_name": "Plaid Brokerage",
      "subtype": "brokerage",
      "type": "investment"
    },
  ],
  "holdings": [
    {
      "account_id": "JqMLm4rJwpF6gMPJwBqdh9ZjjPvvpDcb7kDK1",
      "cost_basis": 1,
      "quantity": 0.01,
      "security_id": "d6ePmbPxgWCWmMVv66q9iPV94n91vMtov5Are",
    },
  ],
  "securities": [
    {
      ...
      "iso_currency_code": "USD",
      "name": "Amazon Inc.",
      "proxy_security_id": null,
      "security_id": "d6ePmbPxgWCWmMVv66q9iPV94n91vMtov5Are",
      "sedol": null,
      "ticker_symbol": "AMZN",
      "type": "equity"
    }
  ]
}
```
Here is the pseudocode implementation of this idea. To see the TypeScript implementation, click [here]().

```
    method parseAccountData(data: Accounts[]): AccountPayload
        accounts := new array of AccountPayload
        for each account in data
            if account.account_id and account.name
                accounts.push({
                    plaid_account_id: account.account_id,
                    account_name: account.name
                })
            end if
        end for
        return accounts
    end method

    method saveAccounts(user_id: string, data: array of AccountBase): AccountMap
        parsedAccounts := parseAccountData(data)
        result := accountRepo.insert(parseInt(user_id), parsedAccounts)

        map := new AccountMap
        for each obj in result
            map.set(obj.plaid_account_id, obj.id)
        end for

        return map
    end method

    method parseSecurities(securities: Security[]): SecurityMap
        map := new SecurityMap
        for each security in securities
           map.set(security.security_id, security.ticker_symbol) 
        end for
        return map
    end method

    method parseHoldings(data: Holding[], securityMap: SecurityMap, accountMap: AccountMap): HoldingPayload[]
        holdings = []
        for each holding in data
            // Get Account ID using the Map
            account_id := accountMap.get(holding.account_id)
            // Get Ticker Symbol using the Map
            ticker_symbol := securityMap.get(holding.security_id)
            // If properties defined, then add to array
            if account_id and ticker_symbol and holding.quantity and holding.cost_basis
                holdings.push({
                    account_id,
                    plaid_account_id: holding.account_id,
                    ticker_symbol,
                    cost_basis: holding.cost_basis,
                    quantity: holding.quantity
                })
            end if
        end for
        return holdings
    end method


    method saveHoldings(user_id: string, holdings: Holding[], securities: Security[], accountMap: AccountMap)
        securityMap := parseSecurities(securities)
        parsedHoldings := parseHoldings(holdings, securityMap, accountMap)

        if parsedHoldings.length == 0
            return []
        end if
	      // Insert into Database
        result := insert(parseInt(user_id), parsedHoldings)
        return result
    end method
```

- Modified the client-side price retrival flow to allow for O(1) time lookups for each holding.
- Precomputed the total position size (cost basis x quantity) for each ticker symbol to efficiently compute the % change (current and total)
